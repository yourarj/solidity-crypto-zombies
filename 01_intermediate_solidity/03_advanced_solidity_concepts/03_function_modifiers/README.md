# 03: function modifier

- It's design strategy to have a contract owner, so crucial function can only be invoked by owner only.

## constructor
- It's optional `special function` which will be executed only once on contract deployment.

## function modifiers
- Modifiers can be used to change the behaviour of functions in a declarative way.
- For example, you can use a modifier to automatically check a condition prior to executing the function.
