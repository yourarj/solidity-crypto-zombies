# 2: ERC721 Standard, Multiple Inheritance

- `token standard` defines shared behaviour.
- It brings generalization to code working with smart contract implementing the token standard.
- some examples are ERC20, ERC721 token standards.

## ERC721
- `ERC721 tokens` are *not interchangeable* since each one is assumed to be *unique*, and are *not divisible*.
- You can only trade them in whole units, and each one has a unique ID.
