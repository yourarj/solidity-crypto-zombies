# 02: Mappings and Addresses

## Address
- An `address` is an unique identifier to an `account`
- An account can owned either by a user or a smart contract
- e.g.
```
0x0cE446255506E92DF41614C46F1d6df9Cc969183
```

## Mapping
- A `mapping` is essentialy a key value store for looking up data.
- e.g.
```sol
mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
```
